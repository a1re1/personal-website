      The Jaluinsky Code </br>
        <ol type="I"><li>Enfranchisement Creed </br>
          <ol type="A"><li>All other server rules are eligible to change with the approval of
           at least a 65% supermajority of members willing to change a law.</li></ol></li>
        <li>Crimes against Jaluinsky</br>
          <ol type="A"><li> Violating rules laid out in this code demonstrates that you no
           longer wish to be protected by this code.</br></li>
         <li>Criminal Definition</br>
            <ol type="1"><li> With the vote of at least 3 other Jaluiskians, by the /accuse
             command, a member will be sent to the courtroom for trial. {Bounty Systems?}</li>
            <li> Disputes between fewer members leave the burden of proof to the accusers.</li></ol></li>
          <li>Trials</br>
            <ol type="1"><li>Trials will be held over the course of a 24 hour time period
             (or until all member have voted) in which server members may evaluate
              all evidence laid out and vote to prosecute. At the the end of such
               trials, should the accused be found guilty, appropriate punishments
                will be granted. Should he be found innocent, the 3 initial accusers
                 must pay repercussions equal to the current market value for 24
                  hours of server time.</li>
             <li> A punishment guide has been laid out at the following source, and
             will be followed under most circumstances.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
        <li>Territory</br>
          <ol type="A"><li>(Raiding/Griefing) Raiding and griefing is prohibited by the the Jaluinsky
           code indefinitely. Should a player disown the code, and be proven guilty
            of raiding, he will have forfeited his protection, and thus those who
             raid his territories shall not be punished by law.</li>
          <li>Player Claims</br>
            <ol type="1"><li>At the creation, founding members will be shown a map of Jaluinsky
             at which point they will lay claim to the settlements. A player may
              declare where he wishes his borders to lie, at which point, a 50%
               approval will set the claim in stone.</li>
            <li>Land claimed after launch is allotted to any player who wishes to
             protect it.</li></ol></li>
          <li>Dueling</br>
            <ol type="1"><li>Land disputes must be handled in a fight to the death. These fights
             must be consensual, and a loserâ€™s items must be returned at the end of the fight.</li>
            <li>This clause can be applied to more scenarios if a group, faction,
             or multiple challengers wish to vie for that same land.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
        <li>Player vs. Player interactions</br>
          <ol type="A"><li>Contracts made between multiple players must be upheld. Violations
           of contracts are considered an offense which can justify a trial by the state.</li>
          <li>Players may not fight without the consent of all involved parties.</li></ol></li>
        <li>Chat Abuse</br>
          <ol type="A"><li>Spamming attracts a mystical bird of prey which is fond of the throat
           of players. This will render a player unable to speak. In order to heal
            such injuries, 10 mages must band together and perform a healing ritual
             outlined here. {9 mages must simultaneously throw 1 block of diamond
                into a pit of lava while the final mage sacrifices the mute player.
                 Upon revival, the throat shall be restored, and the player will
                  be able to talk again.}</li></ol></li>
