        <h>Server Information</h>
        <p>
          Welcome to Jaluinsky. On this server, we wish to play a semi-vanilla minecraft
          experience similar to that of Hermit Craft. We do not use mod packs, but are
          not shy to datapacks and resources packs. In addition, as this server is white-listed
          all members which we screen have been determined to be reasonable players with
          decent intentions. We do not wish to have intensive moderation, and would prefer
          to allow players to self govern themselves. The server rules are set up so that
          players should be able to handle disputes, and we will not intervene until all
          other avenues of settlement have been tried.
        </br></br>The server rules are as follows: The only universal rule is that any other
          server rule can be changed with a super majority of players voting on it. Any one can
          propose a new rule at any time, and any rule that is detrimental to everyone's
          enjoyment can be changed or removed. In addition, these rules must be upheld
          by the players of the server. A rule-breaker will not be banned, but if he chooses
          not to follow the rules, he can't expext other members to abide by the rules when
          interacting with him. In very extreme cases, should a majority of members decide
          that a player is no longer welcome, he can be removed from the server.
        </br></br>In addition, we wish to facilitate positive interactions between players
          with a system built on micro economies, trading, and contracts. Our goal is to use
          our skills and experiences to help each other out when building and gathering
          resources to create extremely large projects that look pretty cool and are
          impressive in comparison to most other minecraft worlds. The currently has some
          datapacks installed to make quality of life changes and make it possible to build
          late game creations more easily. Additional changes to these can be made if voted by
          by the super majority of players.

             outlined here. {9 mages must simultaneously throw 1 block of diamond
                into a pit of lava while the final mage sacrifices the mute player.
                 Upon revival, the throat shall be restored, and the player will
